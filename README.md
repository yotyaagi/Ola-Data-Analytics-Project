Ola Data Analytics Project
“Comprehensive ride booking data analysis using modern analytics tools”

This project involved the end-to-end development of a dynamic analytics dashboard to analyze booking trends and operational metrics for a ride-hailing service. The dataset included over 71,000 booking records for the month of July 2024. The objective was to extract actionable insights related to ride volume, cancellation patterns, payment methods, customer behavior, and driver performance. The raw data was first cleaned and structured in Excel, followed by the use of Power BI for data modeling and visualization. Calculated columns and DAX measures were created to support detailed analysis, including success and cancellation rates, revenue segmentation by payment mode, ride distance trends, and customer segmentation based on booking value. The final dashboard provided an interactive and user-friendly interface for stakeholders to explore key performance indicators. It allowed for the identification of operational bottlenecks such as high cancellation rates and common ride failure reasons, aiding in data-driven decision-making.
